# FILEBOSS Deployment Plan

This document outlines the steps to deploy the FILEBOSS application.

## 1. Infrastructure Setup

*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS
*   **Services:**
    *   EC2 for the application server
    *   RDS for the PostgreSQL database
    *   S3 for file storage
    *   CloudFront as a CDN
    *   Route 53 for DNS management
    *   IAM for access control

## 2. Backend Deployment

1.  **Provision Infrastructure:**
    *   Create a new EC2 instance (t3.medium or larger).
    *   Create a new RDS instance (PostgreSQL).
    *   Create a new S3 bucket for file storage.
    *   Configure security groups to allow traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443.
2.  **Configure the Server:**
    *   SSH into the EC2 instance.
    *   Install Python 3.12, pip, and virtualenv.
    *   Install Nginx and configure it as a reverse proxy.
    *   Install Supervisor to manage the application process.
3.  **Deploy the Application:**
    *   Clone the `fileboss` repository from GitHub.
    *   Create a new virtual environment and activate it.
    *   Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
    *   Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (database credentials, S3 bucket name, etc.).
    *   Run database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
    *   Configure Supervisor to run the Gunicorn server.
    *   Restart Supervisor and Nginx.

## 3. Frontend Deployment

1.  **Build the Frontend:**
    *   On a local machine or a build server, install Node.js and npm.
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    *   Install the required npm packages: `npm install`.
    *   Build the frontend for production: `npm run build`.
2.  **Deploy to S3:**
    *   Upload the contents of the `build` directory to the S3 bucket.
    *   Configure the S3 bucket for static website hosting.
    *   Configure CloudFront to serve the frontend from the S3 bucket.

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification

1.  **Check Application Status:**
    *   Verify that the backend is running and accessible.
    *   Verify that the frontend is loading correctly.
2.  **Run Integration Tests:**
    *   Run the integration test suite against the live server.
3.  **Monitor Logs:**
    *   Monitor the application logs for any errors.

## 5. Rollback Plan

*   In case of a deployment failure, revert the EC2 instance to a previous snapshot.
*   Restore the database from a backup.
*   Roll back the frontend by deploying the previous version from S3.
