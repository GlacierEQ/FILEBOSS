                I used to work for the office of Miles S. Bynar. I worked there from September of 2001 to August 2024.
                I do recall that I believe we had a client with your exact name. And if it's you, I may have met you once.
                I never worked on that case. I believe it was another associate attorney, Sean Fitzsimmons, that worked on that case.
                
                Mr. Brower did not respond to the motion. He doesn't really have an opposition to it.
                I have several motions that are open, unaddressed, more than 90 days, and unanswered.
                This case is a huge mess. I have like four open motions for more than 90 days.
                I believe I'm running a 92% denial rate on pretty reasonable things.
                The court also used my name to put submissions in.
                The minutes from the last hearing were also written by Mr. Brower, so that's weird.
                
                It was 27 days after the deadline and it was filled with inflammatory language.
                This is not reasonable. It's filled with inflammatory language, and that does not belong inside of the decree to begin with.
                It has material facts that are just completely inaccurate.
