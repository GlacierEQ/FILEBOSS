# Enhanced Plan for Legal Knowledge and Structure Improvements in LawGlance

## Information Gathered:
- The `Lawglance` class handles conversational logic and integrates with a language model and vector store.
- The current retrieval mechanism uses a similarity score threshold to fetch relevant documents.
- The prompts used for generating answers can be refined for better accuracy.

## Plan:
1. **Enhance the Vector Store**:
   - Modify the `__retriever` method in `lawglance_main.py` to fine-tune the parameters (e.g., increase the `k` value and adjust the `score_threshold`) for improved document relevance.
2. **Refine Query Processing**:
   - Update the prompts in the `llm_answer_generator` method to be more context-aware.
   - Incorporate example-driven context hints for handling complex queries.
3. **Expand Knowledge Base**:
   - Identify and integrate additional authoritative legal documents.
   - Prioritize resources with high-quality metadata for better indexing.

## Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `lawglance_main.py`

## Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the changes in the identified files.
- Test the application to ensure the improvements are effective.
- Gather user feedback.
