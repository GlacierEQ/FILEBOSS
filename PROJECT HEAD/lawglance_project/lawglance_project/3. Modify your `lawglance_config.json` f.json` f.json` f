3. Modify your `lawglance_config.json` file with your specific settings

## 3. Integration Steps

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Runner (Recommended)

The simplest approach is to use the provided enhanced runner:

```python
from config import Config
from lawglance_integration import LawglanceIntegration
from lawglance_main import Lawglance
from document_cache import DocumentCache
from document_processor import DocumentProcessor

config = Config()
# Access settings with config.get("section", "key")

cache = DocumentCache(config)
doc_processor = DocumentProcessor(config, word_processor, doc_analyzer, concept_extractor, cache)

# Initialize your Lawglance instance as usual
lawglance = Lawglance(llm, embeddings, vector_store)

# Enhance with improved components
integration = LawglanceIntegration("lawglance_config.json")
lawglance = integration.setup_lawglance(lawglance)

# Use as normal
response = lawglance.conversational("Your query")

# Print performance report
performance_monitor.print_report()
```

Now you have a comprehensive set of improvements addressing all the concerns:

1. **Performance Optimization** with:
   - Overlapping document chunking 
   - Document caching system
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Dependency Management** with:
   - Detailed requirements file with pinned versions
   - Graceful degradation when optional dependencies are missing

3. **Configuration Management** with:
   - Central configuration class
   - Default settings and file-based overrides
   - Environment variable integration

4. **Testing Infrastructure** with:
   - Document processor tests
   - Integration utilities

Follow the migration guide to integrate these improvements with your existing system!
