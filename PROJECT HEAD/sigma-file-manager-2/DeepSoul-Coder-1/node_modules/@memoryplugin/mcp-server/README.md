# MemoryPlugin MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for [MemoryPlugin](https://www.memoryplugin.com), enabling AI assistants like Claude to store and retrieve your memories. This server provides a bridge between AI assistants and your MemoryPlugin account, allowing them to:

- Store new memories
- Query existing memories
- Manage memory buckets
- Search across all memories
- Retrieve latest or specific memories

## Setup

### Getting Your API Token

1. Go to [www.memoryplugin.com/dashboard](https://www.memoryplugin.com/dashboard)
2. Find your API token in the dashboard
3. Copy the token for use in configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Configure the server in your Claude Desktop configuration file:

#### Option 1: Using npx (recommended, but currently experiencing issues)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memoryplugin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memoryplugin/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PLUGIN_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Using global installation (current workaround)
First, install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g @memoryplugin/mcp-server
```

Then find your Node.js installation path:
```bash
which node
# Example output: /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v21.7.3/bin/node
```

And find the installed package path:
```bash
npm list -g @memoryplugin/mcp-server
# Look for something like: /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v21.7.3/lib/node_modules/@memoryplugin/mcp-server
```

Use these paths in your configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memoryplugin": {
      "command": "/Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v21.7.3/bin/node",
      "args": ["/Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v21.7.3/lib/node_modules/@memoryplugin/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PLUGIN_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you experience any startup issues with Option 2, please use Option 1 with global installation instead.

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes these tools to AI assistants:

1. `store_memory`

   - Optional bucket assignment
   - Automatically prepends current date

2. `get_memories`
   - Query memories with filters
   - Search functionality
   - Latest/all options
   - Customizable count

3. `list_buckets`
   - View all memory buckets
   - Includes memory counts

4. `create_bucket`
   - Create new memory buckets
   - Organize memories by topic/category

5. `get_memories_and_buckets`

## Example Usage

Here are some example prompts you can use with Claude once the server is configured:

```
Could you store this as a memory: "Had coffee with Sarah at Blue Bottle, discussed upcoming project deadlines"

Can you show me my latest 5 memories?

Search my memories for anything related to "coffee meetings"
```
