- **Data Aggregation:** Leverage legal data aggregators such as **CourtListener** and **Justia API**.
- **AI-Powered Compilers:** Use tools like **GPT-Engineer + LangChain** for summarizing and organizing large volumes of dense legal text.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** The new module `legal_scraping.py` (see implementation/legal_scraping.py) can harvest legal data and feed it into Elasticsearch or similar systems for further analysis.
