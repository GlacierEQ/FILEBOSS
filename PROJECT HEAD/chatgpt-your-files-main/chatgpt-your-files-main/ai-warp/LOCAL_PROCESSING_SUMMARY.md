# AI-Warp CLI: Transformation to Local Processing

## Summary of Changes

We've transformed the AI-Warp CLI project from relying on external servers and potential payment plans to using entirely local PC processing. This shift enhances privacy, security, and eliminates dependency on external services while maintaining all core functionality.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Docker-Based Local Infrastructure
- Created a comprehensive `docker-compose.yml` that provides:
  - PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension for vector embeddings
  - Ollama container for local LLM inference
  - pgAdmin for database management
  - Proper volume management for data persistence

### 2. Direct PostgreSQL Client
- Implemented a new `postgres-client.ts` that:
  - Connects directly to a local PostgreSQL instance
  - Provides vector similarity search capabilities
  - Eliminates dependency on Supabase's cloud services
  - Includes advanced database operations for embedding storage and retrieval

### 3. Local Express API Server
- Created a standalone `server.ts` that:
  - Processes API requests completely on your PC
  - Handles embedding generation via Ollama
  - Manages database operations through direct PostgreSQL connection
  - Provides endpoints for content summarization and similarity search

### 4. Enhanced CLI Integration
- Updated the main CLI to:
  - Manage local Docker services (start/stop/status)
  - Verify local infrastructure health before operations
  - Start API server automatically when needed
  - Provide seamless interaction with local components

### 5. Documentation
- Created comprehensive guides:
  - `SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md` with complete architecture details
  - `GETTING_STARTED.md` for quick local setup
  - Updated `README.md` to reflect the local-first approach

## How It Works Now

1. **Local Infrastructure**: All services run in Docker containers on your PC, providing isolated and consistent environments without external dependencies.

2. **Text Generation & Embeddings**: Ollama processes all LLM requests locally, eliminating the need for OpenAI API keys or other cloud-based LLM services.

3. **Vector Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector stores and retrieves embeddings locally, replacing Supabase's vector database capabilities.

4. **API Processing**: All API requests are handled by the Express server running on your machine, removing the reliance on Supabase Edge Functions.

5. **File Operations**: File scanning, content extraction, and text processing all happen on your local system with no data leaving your PC.

## Key Benefits

### Privacy & Security
- No data sent to external servers (except when fetching web content)
- No API keys required for LLM services
- Complete control over your data

### Cost Savings
- No subscription fees for cloud vector databases
- No API usage charges for LLM services
- No paid tiers for additional features

### Independence
- Works offline (except for web content fetching)
- No rate limits or usage restrictions
- Full control over model selection and configuration

## How to Get Started

The project now offers a simplified setup process:

1. **Installation**: `npm install`
2. **Start Services**: `npm run local:start`
3. **Use CLI**: `npm start -- [command]`

For detailed setup instructions, see the `GETTING_STARTED.md` file.

## Technical Architecture Comparison

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Vector Database | Supabase (cloud-based) | PostgreSQL + pgvector (local) |
| LLM Processing | Hybrid (Ollama + potential cloud) | Ollama (completely local) |
| API Processing | Supabase Edge Functions | Express API Server (local) |
| Authentication | Supabase Auth | File-based local auth (can be implemented) |
| Data Storage | Supabase PostgreSQL | Local PostgreSQL |

## Future Enhancements

While maintaining the local-first approach, we can further enhance the system by:

1. Implementing secure local authentication
2. Adding encrypted storage for sensitive data
3. Supporting multiple local LLM providers beyond Ollama
4. Creating a local web UI for visualization
5. Implementing incremental database backups

This transformation makes AI-Warp CLI a true local-first, privacy-focused tool that puts you in complete control of your data and processing while maintaining all the powerful capabilities of AI-enhanced workflows.
