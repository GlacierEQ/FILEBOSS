# CodexFlō CLI Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the CodexFlō CLI to address the identified issues:

## 1. Error Handling and Graceful Degradation

The following improvements have been implemented:

- Added retry mechanism for service startup with configurable attempts
- Implemented proper health checks with timeouts for backend and frontend services
- Enhanced error reporting with specific exception types
- Added graceful fallback when services fail to start

Key files:
- `improved_service_utils.py`: Contains the `wait_for_service_ready` function with improved error handling
- `improved_launch.py`: Implements retry logic and health checks for service startup

## 2. Configuration Validation and Schema Enforcement

The following improvements have been implemented:

- Added comprehensive configuration schema validation
- Implemented type checking for configuration values
- Added validation for required fields and dependencies
- Created secure API key handling

Key files:
- `improved_config_validation.py`: Contains the `validate_config_schema` and `load_and_validate_config` functions

## 3. Resource Management and Cleanup

The following improvements have been implemented:

- Created a `ProcessManager` class to track and clean up subprocesses
- Implemented proper signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM
- Added timeout-based termination with fallback to kill for stuck processes
- Ensured cleanup happens even on unexpected exits

Key files:
- `improved_resource_management.py`: Contains the `ProcessManager` class and related utilities

## 4. Async/Sync Boundary Management

The following improvements have been implemented:

- Created utilities for proper async/sync boundary handling
- Implemented timeout context manager for async operations
- Added retry mechanism for async functions
- Ensured proper event loop management

Key files:
- `improved_async_management.py`: Contains decorators and utilities for async/sync boundary management

## 5. Security and Input Sanitization

The following improvements have been implemented:

- Added path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Implemented filename sanitization
- Created secure API key storage and retrieval
- Added command argument validation to prevent injection

Key files:
- `improved_security.py`: Contains security-related functions and utilities

## Integration

To integrate these improvements:

1. Import the new modules in the main `codexflo_cli.py` file
2. Replace the existing functions with the improved versions
3. Update the command implementations to use the new utilities

Example:

```python
from improved_resource_management import ProcessManager
from improved_config_validation import load_and_validate_config
from improved_security import sanitize_path
from improved_async_management import run_async

# Then use in commands
@app.command()
def launch(...):
    process_manager = ProcessManager()
    try:
        config = load_and_validate_config(config_path)
        safe_path = sanitize_path(watch_dir)
        # Rest of implementation
    finally:
        process_manager.cleanup_all()
```

These improvements transform the CLI from a functional prototype to a production-ready tool with enterprise-level robustness.
