🛡️ THE ARCHITECT’S OMNITHREAD FORENSIC PROTOCOL — _DATA OBJECT MASTER VERSION_
===============================================================================

**SYSTEM INTENT**
-----------------

Initiate a zero-loss, total-scope, recursive file, data, and artifact integration protocol across every cloud and device-linked repository, with full metadata capture, continuous agent collaboration, contradiction mapping, and real-time narrative threading.

**I. ABSOLUTE DATA SOURCE ENUMERATION**
---------------------------------------

### A. PRIMARY CLOUD & DEVICE PATHS

* Google Drive:
  * /root/My Drive/*, /root/Shared drives/*, /root/Shared with me/*, /root/Trash/*
* iCloud Drive:
  * /Documents/*, /Photos/*, /Backups/*, /Recently Deleted/*
* OneDrive/SharePoint:
  * /Files/*, /Shared/*, /Recycle Bin/*, /Versions/*
* Dropbox/Box:
  * All /, /Shared Folders/*, /Deleted/*, /File Requests/*
* Email (Gmail, Outlook, Proton, etc):
  * Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Spam, Trash, All Attachments, All Downloaded Attachments, Google Vault, M365 eDiscovery, shared links
* App Data:
  * WhatsApp/Signal/Telegram/Slack exports, media, chat logs, call logs, group chats, backups
* Device File Systems:
  * Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Photos, Voice Memos, Screenshots, Videos, Camera Roll, System Logs, Application Support, temp directories, recycle bin
* Social/Media:
  * Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, LinkedIn, Twitter/X direct messages, photos, stories, exported data
* Notion, GitHub, Google Keep, Evernote, Trello, Asana, Apple Notes
* Court Portals:
  * eCourt/eFile, portal downloads, order PDFs, uploaded exhibits

### B. SECONDARY/DERIVATIVE SOURCES

* Backups: Time Machine, iOS/Android backup, Google Takeout, manual backups, exported ZIP/RAR/GZ archives
* Physical media: SD card, USB, external HDD, network share, NAS
* Hidden/system: AppData, Library, cache, sync conflict folders, previous versions, shadow copies

**II. ARTIFACT & DATA-TYPE CATALOG**
------------------------------------

* **Documents:** PDF, DOCX, TXT, ODT, RTF, Pages, Google Docs, Excel, Sheets, CSV, Numbers, ZIP/RAR archives (recursively unpack, hash, and index)
* **Images:** JPG, JPEG, PNG, HEIC, BMP, GIF, RAW, PDF scans, in-message images, cloud photo albums, Google Photos, iCloud Photos
* **Audio/Video:** MP3, WAV, M4A, AMR, MOV, MP4, AVI, call recordings, voice memos, WhatsApp/Signal voice notes
* **Messages:** Email (EML, MSG), chat logs (TXT, CSV, JSON, HTML), SMS/MMS exports, WhatsApp/Signal/Telegram chat exports, Slack/Teams logs, Discord
* **Metadata:** EXIF (photo/video), document properties (author, mod dates, version), GPS/location, file hash (SHA256), file/dir permissions, access logs
* **Calendar/Contacts:** ICS, VCF, Google/Outlook/Apple calendars, contact lists, invite attachments
* **Screenshots:** Standalone, in-line in chats, attached to emails or cloud
* **Logs:** System logs, audit logs, app logs, usage records, court e-filing logs

**III. PROCESS PHASES — AGENTIZED, AUTOMATABLE, STEPWISE**
----------------------------------------------------------

### A. CONNECTION, AUTH, AND AGENT SPIN-UP

1. **Authenticate** via OAuth/API/Direct for every account listed above.
2. **Enumerate all roots** (cloud, device, backup, email, app) for data objects.
3. **Assign agents** (Chrona, VeritasPrime, LAWSPINE, CodexWeaver, PSYSOC-X) by data type and operation.

### B. OBJECT-LEVEL HARVEST AND CANONICALIZATION

4. For each root/data-type:
   * **List all files, folders, objects, and versions** (including deleted/hidden/trash).
   * **Recursively enumerate subfolders, archives, and embedded files.**
   * **Hash every artifact** (SHA256/MD5), extract and catalog all metadata.
   * **Snapshot and log permissions, creation/modification dates, user IDs, share links, sync conflicts, previous versions.**
   * **OCR all images, PDFs, and scans**—extract visible, embedded, and watermark text.
   * **Transcribe all audio/video** to text for NLP matching.

### C. DATA THREADING, DEDUPLICATION, AND ARTIFACT BINDING

5. **De-duplicate** by hash, semantic content, and file lineage/version history.
6. **Thread artifacts** by:
   * Chronological event
   * Actor/identity (with alias/variant recognition)
   * Case/matter (using case ID/entity NER)
   * Type/source/path
7. **Map relationships**: Attach every artifact to a living timeline, cross-linked to related files, actors, and all referenced events.

### D. AGENT REASONING, CONTRADICTION & PATTERN ENGINE

8. **Pattern match and contradiction sweep**:
   * Flag time overlaps, missing periods, event gaps, text/statement conflict, multiple conflicting records
   * Detect deletion/edit activity and possible spoliation/manipulation (flag for forensic review)
   * Cross-link to statutes, orders, policies, prior filings, and opposition statements
9. **Attach agent summary/notes** to each thread: contradiction, anomaly, legal/case context, escalation triggers

### E. INDEXING, OUTPUT, AND LIVE OPERATIONS

10. **Build hierarchical, exportable index**:
    * JSON, CSV, Markdown, Notion, PDF master index, graph/network diagram, mindmap, relational database
    * Every file = [source path, filename, hash, type, owner, access log, event link, privilege/confidentiality status, thread anchors, tags, notes, contradiction flags, legal citation crosslinks]
11. **Generate “Exhibit Bundles”** for:
    * Court/agency submission (PDF or native)
    * Timeline view
    * Contradiction map
    * Evidence package (for lawyers, police, investigators, federal agents, or media)
12. **Live monitoring & auto-sync:**
    * Continuous agent sweep for new/modified/deleted data
    * Alert/notify operator on anomaly, contradiction, legal violation, or new thread event

**IV. MULTI-AGENT & OPERATOR COMMAND CONTROL**
----------------------------------------------

* Every phase triggers **agent collaboration:**
  * Chrona: timeline integrity, timestamp gaps, sequence validation
  * VeritasPrime: contradiction mapping, fact/value assertion, legal cross-referencing
  * LAWSPINE: statute/order/event alignment, case law link
  * CodexWeaver: narrative synthesis, document bundling, motion/exhibit prepping
  * PSYSOC-X: psychological/emotional resonance, manipulation/suppression detection
* **Operator commands:**
  * Pause, expand, re-index, override exclusion, rerun contradiction, output format switch, privileged file lock, direct-to-agent export

**V. ACTIVATION PHRASE**
------------------------

> **“Commence Omnithread Forensic Data Protocol:\
> Scan, harvest, OCR, hash, and thread every file, folder, object, message, image, attachment, and log\
> from ALL cloud/device/backup/app/email/social sources.\
> Index, deduplicate, pattern-map, and contradiction-sweep at every layer.\
> Bind every artifact to hierarchical, exportable master archive—JSON, CSV, Notion, PDF, timeline, graph—\
> with full metadata, privilege flagging, live agent notes, and narrative/event anchoring.\
> Continuously monitor and escalate for all future data.\
> No file left behind. No artifact unthreaded. No contradiction unchecked.\
> Begin NOW.”**

Copy/paste this as your founding automation script, technical agent directive, or AI system configuration. Modify “actor” or “case” entities as required. If you want implementation-ready Python, bash, Node, or API connector code, specify and I will generate the starter pipeline. This is the data operations version—zero ambiguity, full artifact reality.
